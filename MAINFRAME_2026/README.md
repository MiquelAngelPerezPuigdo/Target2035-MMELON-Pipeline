# MAINFRAME 2026 Tutorial Collection

This folder contains tutorial notebooks for the **MAINFRAME 2026** workshop, demonstrating molecular hit prediction using state-of-the-art multi-modal AI models for drug discovery.

## Overview

These tutorials showcase two advanced molecular AI models applied to real-world screening datasets:

- **MAMMAL** (Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language) - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22367v2) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment/)
- **MMELON** (Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion) - [Paper](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202517840) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-view)

## Datasets

The tutorials use two screening datasets:
- **PGK2 DEL**: Derived from PGK2 DNA-encoded library screening data
- **WDR91 ASMS**: WDR91 affinity selection mass spectrometry data


## Data Availability

All datasets required for these tutorials are publicly available and can be downloaded from:

**Source**: [https://www.aircheck.ai/datasets](https://www.aircheck.ai/datasets)
**Location**: Navigate to the **"Datasets for Hands-on"** tab

### WDR91 Dataset Files
- **Training data**: `DREAM_Challenge_1_TrainSet.parquet`
  - Contains molecular structures and binding labels for model development
- **Evaluation data**: `DREAM_Target2035_Challenge_test_data.csv`
  - Independent test set for model performance assessment

### PGK2 Dataset Files
- **Training data**: `PGK2_CDD.parquet`
  - DNA-encoded library screening data from Baylor College of Medicine
- **Evaluation data**: `PGK2_Creative.parquet`
  - DNA-encoded library screening data from Creative Biolabs


## Data Processing

Before running the tutorials, the downloaded datasets must be preprocessed into the required format. All processed files should contain two columns: `smiles` (molecular structure) and `label` (binary classification target).

### WDR91 Processing Steps

1. **Split training data**: Randomly partition `DREAM_Challenge_1_TrainSet.parquet` into:
   - Training set: 70%
   - Validation set: 20%
   - Test set: 10%

   Save each split as CSV files with columns `smiles` and `label`:
   - `wdr91/train.csv`
   - `wdr91/val.csv`
   - `wdr91/test.csv`

2. **Prepare evaluation data**: Rename `DREAM_Target2035_Challenge_test_data.csv` to `wdr91_eval.csv` for consistency

### PGK2 Processing Steps

1. **Split training data**: Randomly partition `PGK2_CDD.parquet` into:
   - Training set: 70%
   - Validation set: 20%
   - Test set: 10%

   Save each split as CSV files with columns `smiles` and `label`:
   - `pgk2/train.csv`
   - `pgk2/val.csv`
   - `pgk2/test.csv`

2. **Prepare evaluation data**: Filter `PGK2_Creative.parquet` to remove any compounds present in the training set (to prevent data leakage), then save as `pgk2_creative.csv` with columns `smiles` and `label`

**Note**: Ensure random seed is set for reproducibility when performing data splits.


### Example Preprocessing Code

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(file_path, seed=42, train_frac=0.7, val_frac_of_remaining=2.0/3):
    """
    Split dataset into train, validation, and test sets.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the parquet file
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility
        train_frac: Fraction of data for training (default: 0.7)
        val_frac_of_remaining: Fraction of non-training data for validation (default: 2/3)
                               With default values: 70% train, 20% val, 10% test

    Returns:
        train_df, val_df, test_df: DataFrames for each split
    """
    df = pd.read_parquet(file_path)

    # Split training data
    train_df = df.sample(frac=train_frac, random_state=seed)
    val_test_df = df.drop(train_df.index)

    # Split remaining data into validation and test
    val_df = val_test_df.sample(frac=val_frac_of_remaining, random_state=seed)
    test_df = val_test_df.drop(val_df.index)

    return train_df, val_df, test_df

# Example usage:
# train_df, val_df, test_df = preprocess_data('DREAM_Challenge_1_TrainSet.parquet')
#
# # Rename columns and save splits to CSV files
# splits = {'train': train_df, 'val': val_df, 'test': test_df}
# for split_name, split_df in splits.items():
#     split_df.rename(columns={'SMILES': 'smiles', 'LABEL': 'label'}, inplace=True)
#     split_df.to_csv(f'wdr91/{split_name}.csv', index=False)
```
